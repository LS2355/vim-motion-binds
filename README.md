# vim-motion-binds
This is just my keybinds and settings for vim (motions) on vs code. included is also a sheet with all of the binds + functions 

to get everything to work 
1.update your settings.json file in vs code with the included "settings.json" file 
  a-you don't need it all exept for the settings that start with "vim"
2.update your keybindings.json file in vs code with the included "keybindings.json" file
